# Food Delivery System

## About
**Food Delivery System** is a Java-based project that mimics the operations of a real-world food delivery service. This system enables users to browse menus, place orders, and track their deliveries. The system is designed with an intuitive user interface and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts to create a modular architecture for scalability. This project showcases skills in software development, including object-oriented design and real-world application of programming principles.

## Features
- **Menu Browsing**: Users can browse a variety of food items from different categories available for ordering.
- **Order Placement**: Customers can select items from the menu, add them to their cart, and place an order.
- **Delivery Tracking**: Once an order is placed, customers can track its progress, including order confirmation, preparation, and delivery status.
- **Intuitive UI**: The system is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy to navigate through different features and processes.
- **Scalability**: The modular architecture ensures that the system can be easily expanded, such as adding new food items or introducing payment options.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The system is built with object-oriented principles to enhance maintainability, reusability, and ease of extension.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used to implement the system.
- **Swing**: A Java-based GUI framework used for building the user interface of the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: OOP principles, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, are used to structure the code and ensure the system is modular and maintainable.


### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for running the project.
